# GTM Portfolio — Engineering Revenue Systems

I build go-to-market systems that turn fragmented tools, messy data, and manual workflows into automated, intelligent revenue engines. This portfolio documents those systems — end-to-end architecture, runnable code, and the thinking behind each design.

### 1. Wati AI-First GTM Engine

**The Problem:** Wati (16,000+ customers, 190+ countries) needed to scale revenue without adding headcount. Lead triage was manual, pipeline health was reactive, and outbound was spray-and-pray. Fragmented tools meant data lived in silos.

**What We Built:** A unified intelligent GTM engine with 7 agents across three workflows:

| Workflow | Agents | What It Does | Why It Matters | 
|----------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| [Lead Lifecycle](./wati-gtm-engine/workflows/lead-lifecycle) | `qualify_lead.py` | Auto-qualifies inbound leads by ICP fit score using 4 weighted factors | Speed to lead drops from hours to minutes |
| [Pipeline Intelligence](./wati-gtm-engine/workflows/pipeline-intel) | `analyze_pipeline.py`, `next_best_action.py` | Daily deal risk scoring (5 factors) + rules-based action recommendations | Catch at-risk deals before they slip |
| [Outbound Detection](./wati-gtm-engine/workflows/outbound-scout) | `scout_signals.py`, `prioritize_outbound.py`, `build_sequence.py` | Scans 4 signal sources, scores accounts, generates multi-channel sequences | Proactive pipeline, not reactive |

**How It Works:**
```
Lead ──► Qualifier (ICP score: industry×size×title×signal) ──► Route to AE / Nurture
Deals ──► Risk Engine (staleness×activity×threading×amount×sentiment) ──► NBA ──► Slack
Signals ──► Scout (jobs/funding/leadership/tech) ──► Prioritizer ──► Builder ──► SDR
```

**Why It Works:**
- Every agent has `--demo` + `--dry-run` modes — reviewers see real output with zero setup
- All n8n workflows are exportable JSON — import into any instance
- Rule-based scoring (no LLM key needed) — runs fully offline
- Modular by design — each workflow operates independently

**Tech Stack:** Python 3 · n8n · SQL · HubSpot · Slack

### 2. AI Content Studio

**The Problem:** Content teams struggle with inconsistent brand voice across channels. Every platform has different rules (LinkedIn char limits, email subject length, blog SEO), but the underlying message should be the same. Without a system, each piece of content requires re-stating brand guidelines from scratch.

**What We Built:** A three-layer content system — research (Firecrawl) → swipe file (Obsidian) → generation (Python agents). A portable `writing-skills.md` compiles brand voice + swipe file patterns + channel rules into a single file that any AI can ingest.

| Agent | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| `compile_skills.py` | Brand kit + swipe file → portable `writing-skills.md` |
| `generate_linkedin.py` | LinkedIn post drafts (2 variants, brand-voice) |
| `generate_email.py` | Cold email & newsletter drafts |
| `generate_blog.py` | Blog outline → full draft with SEO metadata |
| `repurpose.py` | One piece → LinkedIn + email + blog variants |
| `research_scout.py` | Firecrawl-powered performance pattern analysis |

**Why It Works:**
- `writing-skills.md` loads into Claude Projects, ChatGPT Custom GPTs, Gemini — one file, any AI
- All agents have `--demo` + `--dry-run` — see real output with zero setup
- Obsidian-native brand vault — no database, no vendor lock-in
- Research-backed: performance patterns feed the swipe file, which feeds generation

**Tech Stack:** Python 3 · Obsidian · Firecrawl · n8n · Claude/OpenAI/Gemini

### 3. GTM Intelligence Platform

**The Problem:** Sales reps waste hours researching accounts before outreach. Data lives in silos — CRM here, enrichment there, signals everywhere. No single view tells a rep "is this worth my time, and what should I say?"

**What We Built:** Two MCP-native agents (Account Research + Deal Intelligence) that automate the full revenue intelligence pipeline — enrichment, signal scoring, MEDDIC analysis, deal health scoring, and next best actions.

**Agent 1 — Account Research Pipeline (7 steps):**
1. CRM context pull (`search_deals`)
2. Firmographic enrichment (`enrich_account` — Clay mock)
3. Web signal search (`search_web`)
4. Weighted intent scoring (funding 3x, exec 2.5x, hiring 2x, tech 1.5x)
5. Competitive intelligence overlay
6. Structured brief + personalized email generation
7. Write-back to file store + database

**Agent 2 — Deal Intelligence Pipeline (8 steps):**
1. Context assembly (deal owner, stage, ACV, ICP from Agent 1)
2. Transcript fetch (`get_transcript` — Gong mock, 5 multi-turn calls)
3. MEDDIC analysis (6 dimensions: Metrics, EB, DC1, DC2, Pain, Champion)
4. Gap detection (dimensions below 5/10, ranked by risk weight)
5. Similar deal search (mock pgvector against 3 closed-won comps)
6. Composite health score (MEDDIC 40%, ICP 20%, velocity 15%, engagement 10%, ACV 10%, comp 5%)
7. Next best action generation (single NBA from top risk-weighted gap)
8. Governed write-back (`_c` custom fields only) + structured Agent 3 handoff

**Why It Works:**
- MCP-native: 9 typed tools via stdio transport — works in any MCP client
- MEDDIC scoring engine with interactive REPL — live recalc on every dimension change
- Composite deal health scoring across 6 weighted factors
- Governed `score_opp` tool: writes `_c` custom fields only, never canonical CRM fields
- Chain handoff between agents via structured JSON — no prose re-parsing
- Portable skills layer: 6 markdown skills + 5 `.prompt` files load into any AI
- All tools support `--demo` + `--dry-run` modes
- Gong mock returns 5 multi-turn calls with full speaker-turn transcripts

**Tech Stack:** Python 3 · MCP SDK · Claude API · PostgreSQL + pgvector · Redis · Clay (mock) · Gong (mock)

### 4. GTM Enrichment Pipeline

**The Problem:** SDR teams spend hours manually finding decision-makers, guessing email formats, and building lists. Enrichment tools are fragmented — Clearbit here, Apollo there, Million Verifier somewhere else. Without a unified pipeline, data quality drops and outbound campaigns suffer.

**What We Built:** A Clay-inspired enrichment waterfall engine — load 100 companies → find decision-makers → verify emails → score by fit → export to Smartlead.

| Workflow | File | What It Does |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Enrichment Waterfall** | `workflows/enrichment_waterfall.py` | Clay-style multi-source enrichment with confidence scoring per source |
| **Email Verification** | `workflows/email_verifier.py` | Million Verifier pattern: syntax → MX → SMTP verification pipeline |
| **Scoring Engine** | `workflows/scoring_engine.py` | Weighted lead scoring (ICP 35% + seniority 25% + email 20% + signals 20%) |
| **Smartlead Export** | `workflows/smartlead_format.py` | Smartlead-ready CSV with personalization columns |

**How It Works:**
```
input.csv ──► Enrichment Waterfall (try Source A → B → C) ──► 
Email Verify (syntax → MX → SMTP) ──► 
Score (ICP×Seniority×Email×Signals) ──► 
Route (Active 80+ / Nurture 50+ / Excluded) ──► 
Smartlead CSV
```

**Why It Works:**
- `python demo/run.py` — one-command end-to-end with sample data, no credentials needed
- Same architecture as real Clay workflows: waterfall enrichment, conditional routing, weighted scoring
- Maps directly to production tools: Clay, Smartlead, Million Verifier, Airscale, Apollo
- All scoring is rule-based (no LLM key needed) — runs fully offline
- n8n workflow included for visual editing and scheduling

**Tech Stack:** Python 3 · n8n · Clay/Smartlead/Million Verifier (design patterns)
